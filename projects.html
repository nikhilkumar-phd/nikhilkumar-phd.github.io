  <b>Non-contact rail wheel defect diagnostics using air-coupled ultrasonic acoustic emission (MxV Rail)</b>
  <div class="small">
    Air-coupled UAE (20–80 kHz), experimental validation, defect characterization.
  </div>

  <p class="small" style="margin-top:10px;">
    This project, conducted in collaboration with MxV Rail, focused on experimentally validating a non-contact
    diagnostic framework for detecting structurally significant rail wheel defects using air-coupled Ultrasonic
    Acoustic Emission (UAE). The approach enables defect detection without liquid couplants and at operationally
    relevant stand-off distances.
  </p>

  <p class="small">
    Primary contributions centered on the design and execution of controlled laboratory and field experiments,
    including instrumented impact testing, sensor placement optimization, and repeatable data acquisition to
    establish physics-based ground truth. These measurements supported identification of defect-specific acoustic
    signatures and downstream multi-class diagnostic modeling.

    <li>Defect-specific acoustic signature characterization.</li>
    <li>Experimental support for automated diagnostic modeling.</li>

  <b>Experimental investigation of traction-enhancing and traction-reducing agents at the wheel–rail interface (PhD Research)</b>
  <div class="small">
    Third-body layers, roller rig experimentation, traction control, wheel–rail contact mechanics.
  </div>

  <p class="small" style="margin-top:10px;">
    This doctoral research focused on experimentally quantifying the effects of traction-enhancing and
    traction-reducing third-body layers on wheel–rail contact dynamics using the VT–FRA Roller Rig.
    The study examined both naturally occurring contaminants (e.g., leaves) and engineered materials
    (e.g., magnetite and alumina) under controlled longitudinal and lateral creepage conditions.
  </p>

  <p class="small">
    The work emphasized repeatable experimental protocols to measure longitudinal and tangential tractive
    forces, contact patch evolution, and saturation behavior under varying contact conditions.
    Results provided insight into how third-body layers alter effective friction, creep force orientation,
    and traction availability, directly impacting braking performance, curving behavior, and derailment risk.
  </p>

  <ul class="list">
    <li>Controlled evaluation of traction enhancers and reducers under dynamic creepage.</li>
    <li>Quantification of longitudinal and tangential traction coefficients and saturation behavior.</li>
    <li>Experimental insights into traction control, braking loss, and wheel–rail safety.</li>
  </ul>

  <b>Static conformal and two-point wheel–rail contact characterization using pressure-sensitive films (PhD Research)</b>
  <div class="small">
    Conformal contact, two-point contact, pressure-sensitive films, contact patch geometry.
  </div>

  <p class="small" style="margin-top:10px;">
    This study focused on experimentally characterizing static wheel–rail contact conditions under
    conformal and two-point contact scenarios using ultra-low sensitivity pressure-sensitive films.
    Tests were conducted on the VT–FRA Roller Rig to capture realistic contact behavior beyond
    classical Hertzian assumptions.
  </p>

  <p class="small">
    The experiments enabled direct measurement of contact patch area, geometry, and pressure
    distribution under varying cant angles, lateral positions, and angles of attack.
    These measurements were used to identify flange and throat contact behavior, validate
    non-Hertzian contact models, and establish experimentally grounded contact locations for
    subsequent dynamic traction studies and simulation tuning.

    <li>Validation support for non-Hertzian wheel–rail contact models.</li>
