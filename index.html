                I am a PhD researcher in Mechanical Engineering at Virginia Tech, affiliated with the Center for Vehicle Systems and Safety and the Railways Technologies Laboratory. 
                My research focuses on wheel rail contact behavior and its implications for rail vehicle safety and performance.

              <p class="small">
                My doctoral work centers on contact mechanics and tribology, with an emphasis on experimental evaluation of third body layer effects,
                surface finish, and frictional behavior at the wheel rail interface. This work combines laboratory experiments, numerical modeling,
                and data analysis to assess their influence on wear, adhesion, and derailment risk.
                Previously, I have worked on structural and contact analysis of aero engine bolted joints, CAD based design of unmanned aerial systems,
                and prototype development of assistive mobility devices. These projects involved finite element analysis, mechanical design,
                and experimental validation. My broader research interests include rail vehicle dynamics, wheel rail interaction,
                tribology, and applied mechanics, with the goal of developing practical, mechanics-based insights that improve the safety and reliability of rail and transportation systems.
